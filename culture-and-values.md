**Serverless is a group project**

It takes the whole team working together to meet Serverless’ bold and ambitious goals. We help each other and strive to remove any roadblocks slowing our teammates down. We hold each other accountable and communicate expectations clearly through asynchronous communication (Slack, Github, Email) and ask for help when we need it.

**Keep our eyes on the prize**

It’s easy to get distracted when pioneering technology in a new space. We keep the team successful by setting clear goals that start at the company level and work their way down to each individual team member. We focus on results and celebrate success as a team.

**Blaze the trail**

As the first mover in the serverless space our team is bold and ambitious. We think outside the box and are always looking for ways to embrace new technology and make it accessible to our community.

**Open source forever**

The open source community is an integral strategy to our success. We will never forget where we came from and pledge to always give back.

**Simplicity is king**

It’s easy to overly complicate language, code, and projects. We strive to create the most simple and elegant solutions. When communicating we ask, “How can I say this in five words instead of ten?”

**Work with freedom and accountability**

Be a good teammate, honor your commitments, and strive to exceed all expectations. However you manage to do that is up to you.
